# The Ultimate Sublime Hotkeys for Frontend Web Developer

A collection of MacOS Sublime hotkeys I use frequently as a frontend developer dealing with HTML, CSS and Javascript (React).

## Getting Started
Every hotkey here is the default from MacOS Sublime 3 and Packages that I installed.

No custom key mapping is required.

### Prerequisites
The foollowing Sublime Packages are needed for these hotkeys to work:
* [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) - The essential toolkit for web developer
* [ColorHighlighter](https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter) - To display/pick colors in CSS
